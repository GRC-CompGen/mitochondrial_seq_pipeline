# mitochondrial_seq_pipeline
A series of scripts and tools to perform mitochondrial sequence, alignment and analysis

The script `mtseq_processing.sh` details the process of creating appropriate index files, re-aligning to rCRS (if required), variant calling (generating vcf files) and creatation of fasta files. It also creates merged vcf and fasta files for batched experiments.
